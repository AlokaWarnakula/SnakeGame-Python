# SnakeGame-Python
🐍 Snake Game – Python Turtle Project This project is a modern take on the classic Snake Game, built using Python's built-in turtle graphics module. It's part of my learning journey through a Python course, though the code here has been written independently with some structural and visual improvements compared to the original lessons.
